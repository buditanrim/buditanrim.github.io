  Hi, I’m looking for 6 young and passionate product designers for 3 months of virtual mentorship. The objective is to work together on shaping your design career based on your current challenge and needs. It's totally free! <br/><br/>

  You will commit to 8 hours (8 session x 1 hour) in total for 3 months (Feb 1 - Apr 14). <br/><br/>

  I do this with two motivations: 1) Giving back to the community by sharing my experience and helping junior designers to thrive in the industry, and 2) Understanding common struggles in the industry today. I’ll use that as a basis of my book to help more junior designers and students on a larger scale.
