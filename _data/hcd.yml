# intro
intro-paragraph: In 2018, we had to take a hard look; there were many misalignments, unclear problems when building products, and the outcome was not so great. While the company had been going well for the last 10 years, the successful outcome was not always intentional. We wanted to improve this.

# Problem
problem-p: "To better understand the problem, I initiated a co-creation session with everyone from each function — marketing, legal, product, business, engineering, design, and data — to share their pain points during the discovery and development phases. There are two problem space we want to tackle:
  <br/><br/>
  1. Products built base on the unvalidated assumptions (hunches)
  <br/><br/>
  2. The silos creates misalignment

# mission
mission-eyebrow: Big Intent
mission-title: Empower product teams to have better alignment and mindset to produce valuable products for customers, to have a sustainable business.



# Pilot
pilot-eyebrow-1: Challenge around alignment & collaboration
pilot-title: How might we enable teams to align better and deliver  user outcome quickly?
pilot-eyebrow-2: The pilot
pilot-paragraph: We brought human-centered toolkits to improve team alignment and did a small experiment. We joined two teams who are open to enhancing their collaboration. The feedback was positive, and the team agreed that the alignment was far better. That serves as our foundation to get a bigger investment.


quote-opening: After the team practices this toolkit and adopt the mindset. The team expressed positive reactions and felt their alignment had been improved. Even though the projects' outcome was not on the level that we wanted to achieve. This qualitative feedback gave us confidence to move forward.
quote-1: “We should do this sooner, so our team can align what outcome we aim and have a better discussion.” 
quote-2: “This is the first time I felt I'm on the same page with my PM from the get-go. I want to learn more about this.” 
quote-3: “The intent statement was brilliant. It helped to align different perspective to everyone during the product development” 
quote-4: “There were moments I felt the activity is a bit repetitive. But, I feel our team identified the real user problem.” 


# Scale
scale-eyebrow-1: Scaling it
scale-title: How might we scale the practice?
scale-eyebrow-2: asd
scale-challenge: After the small success from the pilot, we wanted to scale this mindset and practice to the larger scale in our company. We started by influencing the design team as the first approach.


scale-vision-eyebrow-1: Setting up vision
scale-vision-text-1: We rallied the concept of building alignment as the primary theme to the design team. We wanted to influence the organization-wide through designers.

# Bootcamp
bootcamp-eyebrow-1: Enabling people through bootcamp
bootcamp-challenge: With everyone excited about the vision, we held a Bootcamp series where I spent my time empowering the team to test the toolkit and mindset within the real context. Our goal was to enable them to foster this practice in their team. After a while,  people from Product and Technology joined by interest.

bootcamp-outcome-p: This Bootcamp series empowers some people to gain enough confidence to practice the human-centered mindset and toolkit in their team. A few still don't have the confidence yet. Each of the managers uses their unique approach on how to empower them. We started to see a more collaborative environment around the company.
bootcamp-outcome-1: 120 people joined the bootcamp
bootcamp-outcome-2: 97.1% found this bootcamp practical




#framework
framework-eyebrow-1: Scaling with framework
framework-title: Framework for co-creation
framework-challenge: Heavily inspired by IBM Design Thinking, we adapted it to our own company's vocabulary. We also simplified the visualization to help people digest it. This activity will help team to have a collaborative process and human-centered mindset throughout the discovery phase.




# Implementation

implement-paragraph: When people started practicing the co-creation, we started to see a transformative change in our day-to-day culture. The discussion will be more on the customer, people start to ask why.
