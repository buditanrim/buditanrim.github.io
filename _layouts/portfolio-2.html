			<p class="t--eyebrow-blue m-b-xs">The hesitation to contribute</p>
			<p class="t--heading-02">
				Designers at Bukalapak were hesitant to contribute to the Bazaar design system; thus, the system didn't evolve as it supported 40+ products across the company. Some designers would only use components from our library even when it's not optimal. Others would create their custom components but didn't share it with the design system team. We wanted to find out why.

			<p class="t--heading-01">I led a team of 3 designers and 8 engineers. In this project, I empowered the designer through the discovery process, helped them navigate the ambiguous problems, and involved in the strategy discussion of the overall concept to improve the contribution experience.</p>

			<p class="t--body-02 m-b-l">We tested the concept by announcing this to a few small groups. Three designers who were starting their projects signed up. We partnered a design system designer with a product designer to solve their specific challenge and need.<br/><br/>
			The reactions were positive. These whiteboard sessions were effective. One product designer realized they didn’t need to change a component to solve the design problem. Instead, she makes small tweaks to the layout and the flow. Having a sparring partner was proving its worth.
