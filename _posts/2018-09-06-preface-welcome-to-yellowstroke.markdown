# Dear reader, welcome
Hello! Those dialogue between me and my friend talked about how different our perspective when we were looking the same cloud during our trip. To be frank, it has nothing to do with this post.

In this post, I want to talk about the core reasons why I put this blog together.

### Why I created this blog
The more I work in this mysterious “design” industry, the more I discover newer puzzle ahead of me. And as I solve or understand more mysteries, I'd love to use this blog as a way for me to share what I’ve learned with you from the practical standpoint — I hope it will be useful to you.

Think of this blog as a better version of my notebook.

### The scope of this blog
In this blog, I’ll talk about various things from the design methods that I’m experimenting, the takeaways from the projects, some tips or tutorial, or even `mistakes` that I learned from. 
 
Hopefully, I can resist the temptation from sharing something outside of the scope, like food or travel story. I’m not making any promises though!

### How you can participate
You are more than a reader. You are the critical part to evolve this blog to become better. I am a believer that an open and healthy discussion is always beneficial.

You can [ask questions][mail-ask], too! And if you think the post is worth sharing, it's always appreciated :)
