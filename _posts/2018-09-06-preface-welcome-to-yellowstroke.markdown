_One day I asked my friend, “Hey, what’s that on the sky?”_  
_“You mean those clouds(?)” he replied, confusedly._  
_“No, it’s the face of a tiger.”  I added._

# Dear reader, welcome
Hello! Those dialogue between me and my friend talk about how different our perspective when we were looking the same cloud during our trip. To be frank, it has nothing to do with this post.

In this post, I want to talk about the core reasons on why I put this blog together. Therefore, it called Preface.

### Why: Never ending questions
The more I work in this mysterious design industry, the more I realize another bigger puzzle in front of me. As I solve or understand more puzzles, I want this blog to be a channel for me to share what I’ve learned with you from the practical standpoint — I hope it will be useful to you.

### The scope of this blog
In this blog, I’ll talk about various things like some of the design methods that I’m experimenting, the takeaways from the projects, some tips or tutorial if I find them valuable to share, or even mistakes that I’ve learn from.  
Hopefully I can avoid the temptation to share too many food story.

### How you can participate
