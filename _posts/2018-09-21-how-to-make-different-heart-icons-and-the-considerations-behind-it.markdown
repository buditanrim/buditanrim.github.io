Not only heart icon is universal, ofen it also implies a very positive meaning; love, favourite, like, and more.

What's interesting is the heart icon is challenging, yet super fun to make if you know the secret behind it. Here are some of the ways you can make them.

### A: One square with two circles technique
This one is an interesting way to make a heart with one square combined with two circles.

{% include gif.html url="/img/post/2018/09/square-circles.png" %}

**Design consideration:** The bottom corners has a lot of negative space. However, you can tweak it further, but before you're doing that. Consider the 2nd technique below.

### B: Two circles unified technique
Okay, the first is my favourite (_you see, heart icon can represent how I feel!_).

{% include gif.html url="/img/post/2018/09/two-circle.png" %}

To start off, create 2 circles and then... Viola.

**Design consideration:** This technique results a chubby heart, which actually good because it's not creating a hole of negative space around the bottom corners.

**Pay attention:** When using this technique, pay a close attention on how close you're putting the 2 circles together. Too close or too far will create a weird top heart part.

### C: Two ovals overlaps technique

### D: Three squares technique
{% include gif.html url="/img/post/2018/09/three-squares.png" %}
Start with 3 squares, 



# Comparison
What? You care about performance, efficiency, and all that? Well, I wouldn't be surprise. 

Let's compare them based on efficieny (steps to create), anchor points and file sizes.

Let's take a look from the how many anchor points created, shall we?

### Step efficiency
Let's take a look on the efficiency, this means, how many keystrokes and clicks we need to make the icon. Oh, this include some adjustment steps to make it pixel perfect because you don't want them to be blurry, right?  
A: 9 steps  
B: 7 steps  
C: 9 steps  
D: 8 steps  

# Closing chat to the reader
Sometimes, making an icon is like putting the puzzle pieces together; you don't have to draw them manually. Instead, use some of the basic shapes to help you achieve that. I hope this technique can give you a peek on how I normally make an icon.
