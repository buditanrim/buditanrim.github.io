_"I think Domino's pizza is better than this one."_  
_"Are you crazy?! This is the best pie in the town."_  
_"No, come on.."_

Sounds familiar?

Having countless debates to make an agreement with your friends is commonly happens because there is different opinions or values. And to be frank, using opinion is not the best thing to have an agreement.

This also very common to happen in your UX or design team. Each team member might have their own personal perspective and we started to argue about what's better and what's not.

## Adopting design principles to your team
While I work at Shopify, Polaris have the [principles][polaris-principles] that is contribute back to what we think is true and why.

## Is it really valuable?
Now, the elephant in the room, is it worth the time to create bunch of words? To be honest, I used to be a person who sees principles just as a set of "cool" words. I was inexperience and all my focus was on the hard skill and all that.

Of course, creating good principles takes time. However, once you have solid principles that people agree upon. It will save you a lot of time from time-sucking discussion or debate while working for a project.

## 

> Principle: a fundamental truth that serves as the foundation for a system of beliefe or a chain of reasoning.
