Having countless debates to make an agreement happens because there are different opinions, values, and belief. Honestly, this happens in a lot of team. Where people will start to have a debate and using their own personal taste and opinion. This can drag you to a time-sucking debate that will lead you nowhere.

One way to avoid this is by creating a set of principles.
But... is it worth the effort?

### Chaotic tourists
When talk about the importance of having principles, I like to use this tourist metaphor. Without a solid principle in your team, everyone will talk with different language. It's like telling a French, an Italian, and a Korean to go to the same room and say "Go talk to each other." 

If you think about it, that's pretty insane. So, if you're wondering, is it worth it to invest time to create principles? Most of the time, the answer is yes.

## Why bother to create one?
While I work at Shopify, our design system, Polaris<sup>1</sup>, already have a solid set of [principles][polaris-principles] that serve as source of truth for the whole organization.

So, why bother to create another one?

To start off, in our project, we had a hard time to make a decision when there is a trade-off. Later, we quickly realize that the high-level principles are the north star of the organization and not necessarily can cover all the details. This is the main reason why we started to feel a need to adopt the Polaris principles and make our own.

The project was about improving the card UI system we have. I was lucky because I had a chance to lead this project. So, I want to share my learning and the process on how we did it.

## Planning & research
Since we have the existing design and wanted to improve them. I quickly realize that we should start there. So, we did an extensive audit on our design combined with the data we have from the users' feedback.

##### 1. Workshop: defining the problems
We gathered as a team and spent an hour to define the problems on the existing design. What we did was pretty straight forward, we observed few the elements of the existing design and put the problem on the post it.

**Tips:**
- If you're facilitating, prepare beforehand and set the agenda
- Use super sticky post it. Ugh, normal sticky post sucks!
- Involve your team, but keep it small

##### 2. Grouping the problems
Once we finished, we have tons of post it on the wall. We grouped the similar problems together and label them. This helps us to focus on the bigger picture.

##### 3. Prioritize the problems
Since there are a tons of problems, we won't be able to cover everything. Therefore, we prioritize the problems, we voted on what we think is the top 4 problems that we want to avoid.

## Drafting the principles
Once we have the prioritization, the team decided to put me in charge to draft the first round of the principles. This approach has its own pros and cons. But we believe that was the most efficient approach we can take at that time.

I use the problems as the fundamental, the role of having the principles that will remind us on what's important and why. After weeks consulting with few people in the organization, reviewing them together with the team, and a countless revisions. We were able to come up with the set of principles that represent the "ideal" experience we wanted our card UI to have.


## The result
As a result, the principles really helps us to make decision faster whenever we have few options. Not to mention, the team can easily give a push back whenever my work is not hitting important principles.

This means, shared language that can help us to stay aligned. Here's the principles we ended up with:

1. Focused: Promote one clear purpose
2. Glanceable: Provide quick and easy information processing
3. Personalized: Tailor the unique experience 
4. Valuable: Focus on merchant's benefit
5. Aesthetic Integrity: Integrate the appareance with the function 

## Practical application
But, Budi<sup>2</sup>, how does the principles help?  
I'm glad you asked!

Well, let's take a look on the card below. The content is not personalized and not valuable to the users, it selfishly promote the new section in our admin. Also, there are a lot of problems behind this card beyond the surface that will rather long for me to explain. Basically, it's bad, like, really bad.

class="large" %}
<br/>
While re-think the card above using the principles. I find that me and the team is become more willing to push the boundary because we can envision how better the card will be. We also have a shared language, which is really cool because someone come up to me and say _"I don't think it's glanceable. Let's find a better way."_ How efficient is that? I know what they're talking about.
