On my second month at Bukalapak, we started having a discussion about evolving our Design Principles. After a few months working and advocating for it. I had a chance to share it on [Medium][medium]. On that post, I shared some of the key highlights that I think are worth sharing, a bit of the process, and how we managed to keep things on track by having a certain criteria for "good" principles. 

Go ahead and give [it a read][medium]. I hope you enjoy them.
