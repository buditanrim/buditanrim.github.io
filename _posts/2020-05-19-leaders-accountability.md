Lately, I have asked some design managers in my company, "When was the last time you gave feedback to your direct report?" Often than not, they will either forget when was the last time or they will say, "Probably... On the last peers review."

I mean, it's not the end of the world. Everything will operate like usual. However, you're missing a big chance to make your team more effective. And if you are in a managerial role who haven't give your direct report feedback in the last 3 months, please do it now! For you who have done it, give yourself a pat on your shoulder.

If you are planning to give feedback, here are a couple of things you should keep in mind:

Be specific on what they did well
Be specific on what you observe them struggle with, set a high-level expectation of success for them, but let them deal with the detail

## What to evaluate?
Do they collaborative enough?
Do they a team player?
Do they critical enough?
Is there anything you want them to improve?
How are their ability of articulating feedback toward other's people works?
How are their ability to articulate
How proactive are they?
Do they have enough visibility?



## What to double down?
