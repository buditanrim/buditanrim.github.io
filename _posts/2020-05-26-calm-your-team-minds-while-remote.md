It was 3 PM and I just need to get through my last meeting. I feel nauseous as I jump to other meetings. I juggled between Slack channels while having a discussion with my team. After the meeting, another question suddenly pops as I wrote it on Slack.

I was overwhelmed and so do my team.

I asked myself, "Is it really that much? I usually can do this with no problem." Then, I realized my mind was too disorganized.

As the remote working becomes a new normal, I need to be mindful of how we communicate. If I keep throwing questions or chat every few minutes here and there. I don't set a proper environment for my team to get things done and produce outcomes. For you who struggle with the same situation, I have experimented with a few things and here are a few things that work so far:

**Understand online meeting is totally different from face-to-face meeting**. It requires more cognitive load because it forces us to focus more intently on the conversation. You're no longer look at the sign from body language, you're looking to the mute symbol and voice from your headphone. Just know that is different. So what you can do about this?

- Commit to 3-5 minutes break in between meetings
- When possible change the meeting into an email discussion

**Set crafting time.** We need to get things done no matter what our title is. It's important to protect your time to think or time to make. However, in order to do this, the whole team needs to be agreed upon the rules and respect each other's crafting time. A few action items:

- Block 3-4 hours of crafting time
- Quit Slack or whatever your team communication tool
- Avoid any in-between meetings to reduce context switching

**Asynchronous communication whenever possible.** Slack is a great communication tool. But you can easily trigger other's people attention and distract them from an endless chat.

- Change your chat habit to email whenever possible
- Write down all questions or discussion point and send them at once

**Slow down.** Don't rush, we all want to get things done. But if we keep do busy works, are we get anything done?

If you're in a leadership position, this is a great opportunity to set gameplay. Here's my email to my team.
