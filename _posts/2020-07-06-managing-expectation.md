Show it to us if you're finished.

Tell us your progress.

Tell us if you need more time.

Don't make us ask.

If you planned to have a meeting with your team to talk about the outcome of the project, make sure you make it. The level of trust between you with your teammate is essential. If you give an expectation but can't meet that. You should communicate, no matter what.

Hiding and being quite is not gonna help.

Be proactive.

Set the right expectation, then try your best to meet that expectation, and communicate if there are blockers in between. The transparency your the process will build trust.
