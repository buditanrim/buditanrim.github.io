Take a deep breath before you present. Be comfortable spending a few minutes setting the context before diving into the main nugget. 

Help everyone to recall how the progress of the project so far. Lay the ground for people to discuss: Where did we left off last time? What was the goal? What's the problem? What's the desired outcome? What's the assumptions or questions?

Set the context at the beginning of your meeting. It helps people to discuss productively and help make better decision.
