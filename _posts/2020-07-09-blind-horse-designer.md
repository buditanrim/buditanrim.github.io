Well, I use that component because there is no other component.

My stakeholders said my page have to be colorful, so I did it.

I did that because it is what it is.

You'd be surprise to meet designers with this mindset. They take things too literal. They don't think critical enough. Imagine if a non-design people said they want the page to be colorful. They probably doesn't mean it that way, if they have better vocabulary, they'd say: Can we somehow emphasize this part? One of the way to do it is by make it colorful.

It's unfortunate, because maybe the environment shape some people to be like that. They probably tired and end up having that mindset.

Are you a blind horse designer?

I hope not. Let's think.
