Nike makes shoes for individuals who enjoy sports.

IKEA makes furniture for millenials seeking for cost effective.

Shopify makes commerce ecosystem for someone seeking for independence.

If you think about it, no matter how common the item, there is always specific "someone" to target. A pen is a common thing we all have. But it created for specific audience. Someone in school or someone who work in the office. 

When designing a product or experience with your team, ask a question of who are we designing for. And be specific.

Being specific can benefit your team to dig deeper and talk to specific persona, which sometimes can make your experience have a specific differentiation or value proposition. When you ready to launch, craft a specific message for those audience.

Demographic can help. But try to look for behavioristic and psychographic variable.
