Nike makes shoes for individuals who enjoy sports.

IKEA makes furniture for Millenials seeking for cost-effective.

Shopify makes commerce ecosystem for someone seeking for independence.

If you think about it, no matter how common the item, there is always specific "someone" to target. A pen is a common thing we all have. But it created for a specific audience. An art student or a writer. 

When designing a product or experience with your team, ask a question of who are we designing for. And be specific.

Being specific can benefit your team to dig deeper and talk to specific persona, which sometimes can make your experience have a specific differentiation or value proposition. When you ready to launch, craft a specific message for those audiences.

Demographics can help. But try to look for the behavioristic and psychographic variables.
