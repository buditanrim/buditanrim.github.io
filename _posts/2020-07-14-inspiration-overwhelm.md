Open up Pinterest, Behance, or Dribbble.

Scroll... scroll... scroll...

I'm slouching a bit.

Face resting on my hand, get overwhelmed.

When I tried to look for inspiration and hope it will come as the rescue, but instead, I felt overwhelmed. So, how to overcome this?

What I find helpful is to frame specific questions I am tackling now, which will help to keep my focus when browsing for inspiration. Less overwhelmed because I know which one I should skip and which I should keep.

For example: How can I layout a chapter title in a book? or How to put a testimonials in my mobile layout?

Set a goal even before you open your favorite website for inspiration. That can be a question, goal, specific design challenge.
