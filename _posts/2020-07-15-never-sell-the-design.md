I recently talked with a group of designers and researchers. They expressed the frustration of why their team is not listening to their research finding and suggestion.

Not all companies value user experience as their priority when making decisions. Naturally, the culture reinforces people to make decisions and prioritize what is beneficial for the business. Then the frustration emerges when the team was not solving any real customer problem.

With this in mind, we can’t sell the design. Meaning, we can’t say to people how important it is for the user. What I find effective is to translate those into business language.

For example, instead of saying: If we don’t fix this, our users can’t track their payment really well. Compare it to this: If we don’t help our users to track their payment, this can create confusion and cost us $200,000 per year of customer support contacts. The latter is likely to catch people's attention.

The business activity either increases revenue, maintains revenue, reduces cost, or avoids the cost.

What business impact resulted in your project?
