There was one point in my career that I feel clueless.

I felt like everyone in my team is having opposing opinions and I confused about which one should I listen to. Which lead me to paralysis and unable to make decisions. Fortunately, I had a mentor that helps me understand that I'm overwhelmed because I don't separate truth and assumptions.

What my Product Manager said not necessarily a truth. It's an assumption. It's okay to have an assumption too, but we need to separate them. I later actively capture every point in a post-it and separate them into two columns: 1) assumptions and 2) truth.

This helps me because then I can move forward knowing that part is an assumption and we need to find a way to validate them. Either by finding data to validate, or maybe do quick testing.

When somebody says something, ask yourself, is that assumption or does it have concrete evidence to qualify as a truth?
