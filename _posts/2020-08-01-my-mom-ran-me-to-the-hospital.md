In 2011,  I discovered the world of design.

That was a good time. I always woke up with a lot of energy, wondered what next learning I will find on the internet. I got so excited to play with the tools, read articles about design, and watched as many tutorials as possible.

I took accounting at university, but I didn't want to be an accountant. So, I dedicated all my free time to enter the design contest, hoping to be a designer one day. On the summer break, I took it to the extreme. I sat in front of the computer all day, except when I eat or need to go to the bathroom. I want to be better.

One morning, I woke up and barely can move. I called my mom and she ran me to the hospital. The doctor said I was dehydrated. Fortunately, I quickly recovered within hours after they put a huge needle to my arm.

I thought working hard will make me better. But, did I?

After I fully recovered, I asked myself, what exactly am I getting from working non-stop? I made my mom worried and end up in the hospital, that's all. Probably I got better at using Photoshop and Illustrator at that point. But, I'm not practically a better designer.

From that point, I started to realize, I need to constantly find a way to work smarter, not harder. Here are a few questions you can use to reflect:

- How can I finish a task quicker next time?
- How can I avoid mistakes that cost me time?
- Have I put a time to break so you don't burn out?
- Have I take care of my body and mental state?
