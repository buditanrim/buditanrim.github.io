Last month, I assembled a new team.

I didn't know why, but something felt not right.

In every meeting, I tried my best to communicate the intention and articulate the expectation of the outcome. However, in the next meeting, they aren't making progress as I expected.

I soon realized the team is working in a very abstract territory. They're working in a new space. Everything is fuzzy. 

I start an experiment. At the end of the meeting, I asked everyone to summarize their next step. What interesting is, even after the discussion, some people don't know what they should do next.

After doing this a few times, the progress is starting to be seen. Later, I also ask them a specific date when the action point is expected to be finished. It works. However, I also worry if this puts too much emphasis on the task rather than the overall intention itself. I guess I will be the broken radio and we'll improve bit by bit.

After a meeting, think about: What's your next step?
