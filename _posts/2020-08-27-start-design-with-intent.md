After you have a problem and identified the root cause, don’t jump into thinking what’s the solution right away.

Ask yourself and your team: Knowing the problem we have, what’s our intent? What is the outcome we are hoping to achieve?

As the project progresses, things can get complicated in that situation. Your team could start to lose the bigger picture if there is no alignment about the outcome. But, if your team aligns with the actual outcome, you’re trying to get. Chances are, your team will do fine and can make good decisions.

After your team aligns with a specific problem and outcome to achieve. By then, think about the solution that can solve the problem and achieve the intended outcome.

I love the framework IBM has, that I start scaling it in my team too. Internally, we called it the intent statement. The multidisciplinary team will sit together and ask themself: What is our intent? They will break it down into three parts: 1) Who is the audience/user, 2) What enablement we want to give to the user, 3) What is the differentiator factor.

The intent statement aligns team members with the desired outcome and can be referred back whenever they bogged down with details.

It's also beneficial to understand how impactful this project would be, before you dive in.

So, what’s your intent for the user?
