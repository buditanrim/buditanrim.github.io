After you have a problem, don't jump into thinking what's the solution right away.

Ask yourself and your team: Knowing the problem we have, what's our intent? What is the outcome we are hoping to achieve?

As the project progresses, things can get complicated. In that situation. Your team could start to lose the bigger picture if there is no alignment about the outcome. But, if your team align about the actual outcome you're trying to get. Chances are, your team will do fine and can make good decisions.

After your team align with a specific problem and outcome to achieve. By then, think about the solution that can solve the problem and achieve the intended outcome.

I love the framework IBM has that I start scaling it in my team too. Internally, we called it the intent statement. The multidisciplinary team will sit together and ask themself: What is our intent? They will break it down into three parts: 1) Who is the audience/user, 2) What enablement we want to give to the user, 3) What is the differentiator factor.

This gives the team a way to align their intention of the project and will be referred back whenever they bogged down with all the details.

So, what's your intent for the user?
