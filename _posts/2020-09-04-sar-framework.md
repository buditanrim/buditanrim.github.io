You must have heard storytelling is important for our work.

But what type of storytelling? Is this Aristotle’s Pathos, Logos, Ethos? Or Disney’s style of storytelling?

We need a practical and simple framework to get the point across effectively. This is where the SAR framework can help us; it stands for Situation, Action, Result. It is commonly used for interview techniques and I find it helpful to structure information and communicate effectively.

It’s useful to communicate a project’s progress to stakeholders, share your perspective, or communicate the rationale behind your decisions.

- Situation: What's the current situation? Where are we now?
- Action: What have we done? Or what steps that we will be doing next?
- Results: What happened as the result of your actions? Or what will be the desired result after you take the actions?

To give you a real case scenario, imagine if we want to communicate our product performance's progress. You can use this framework to communicate the plan, like so:

**Situation**: We currently still at 40% of the target in this quarter. **Action**: We pulled data and noticed there’s a massive drop in the number of people sign up. We suspect our marketing message could send the wrong signal to the audience, or there’s an issue with usability in the signup process. We’ll put our resources to figure it out. **Result**: If we can pull this off and stabilize the signup rate before next month, we could be potentially on track to hit the target.
