Did the last project go well?

How would you be more effective in a meeting?

What would you improve for your next project?

When was the last time you ask this question?

Asking this reflective question is important if you want to grow.

Not everyone has the luxury to meet a mentor in their career. I started as a self-taught designer. I never had a mentor. So, I learn by myself. I grow professionally and personally, thanks to the time I spent to reflect.

The research found that employees who spent 15 minutes at the end of the day, reflecting on lessons learned, performed 23% better after ten days than those who did not reflect.

When you reflect, you criticize yourself, look for new opportunities, and learn how to be more effective gradually.

You grow as you reflect.

Take a pause.

What do you want to sustain? What do you want to change?
