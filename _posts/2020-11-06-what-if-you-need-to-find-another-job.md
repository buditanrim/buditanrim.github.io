What would be the project you proud of? What impact had you made? Will you be proud to show that in your portfolio?

As designers, our portfolio speaks the volume. The recruiter won't care about your education or Bootcamp certificate.

So, if you have to find another job tomorrow, are you ready?

This train of thought is not to endorse you to move to another job. Instead, it encourages you to reflect continuously and not be in the comfort zone. It gives you motivation to start preparing. Most importantly, you should start re-evaluate your impact in your current role.
