When the company's leadership doesn't give a space for uncertainty, the team often gets a feature request.

As soon as the request was committed, it's almost impossible to change them.

The problem with feature requests is that the team can't pivot even if they found it does not solve customer problems. It happens because the leader already had the expectation the team will deliver that specific feature.

The team will focus on the output instead of the outcome. They will start to celebrate success when they deliver features instead of delivering value to the customer.

The feature request is stupid.

The alternative is to set the objective, not hand down the solution. If you're a leader, you should be strategic, communicate the vision, and remember you don't always right. Your feature request is probably not going to solve any problems, especially when there is no validation or concrete data to prove your hypothesis.

Feature request is mostly a hypothesis. It's stupid to invest and execute it right away. You're gambling.

Set the objective. Give space to discover unknown unknowns. Focus on the outcome, not the output.
