I work in the industry for more than a decade. I have been getting similar questions repeatedly from junior product designers who are struggling to navigate their careers. 

I've been wondering: Why do I get all of these similar questions?

Last month, I decided to talk to some of my blog's readers, reaching out to the community, jump into the video call when someone reaches me out on LinkedIn. What I can assume so far is there is so little practical guidance for the product design.

This month, I decided to quit Bukalapak. I will spend my next 4 months to give back to the community as much as I could.

My first tactic is to share small bits of insights through this blog. Then, I also open up a mentorship program. I want to aim for junior product designers who have been in the industry for 2-4 years but feel like they need guidance. This will also help me understand the challenges young designers face. I can use it as the basis for my book dedicated to helping design enthusiasts and young designers.

I want to help them thrive, so they can have ripple effects in the industry. I will start small, aiming to cover 6 people.

Join my first batch of [virtual mentorship program][link-mentorship]!
