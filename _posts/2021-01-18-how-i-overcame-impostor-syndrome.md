*I’m not worthy of being here.*

That how I felt in my early time with Shopify.

One windy spring morning, I took sick leave. I wasn’t physically ill, but I was mentally exhausted. I felt small among my teammates. Everything I learned from my previous experience wasn’t 100% working. My confidence hit the low-point. *Why did they hire me?*

I questioned my ability.

I didn’t know there is a name for the feeling I experienced. It called Impostor Syndrome, coined in 1978 by two American psychologists, Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes. 

Fortunately, Shopify provided a life-coach, and I booked a session. The coach was amiable; she was trying to understand what triggers my worry. That conversation brought a realization to us that I had been playing a narrative on my own head. In that narrative, I project how people think of me or ridicule me. After she gave me some perspectives, she told me to experiment with two approaches. So I did.

### Reframe my narrative

The first one is a small thing but really powerful. I will reframe my doubt and the narrative on my head. For example, if I want to voice my opinion, I will force myself to think, "I will speak with no ill intention." Rather than, "I will be ridiculed if I speak." It helps me break the narrative out of my head and remember that my pure intention. Turned out this is one of the recommendation based on <sup id="a1">[1](#fn1)</sup>

### Seek for validation

Second, I tried to be proactive in seeking feedback about myself. Whenever we completed a project, I reached out to my team for feedback. It helped me to understand how people actually think of me. The environment in Shopify allowed me to get constructive feedback, I got the list of what I will need to improve and what I need to keep doing.

Those two small actions didn't instantly resolve my anxiety. Instead, it gradually helped me to focus on delivering impact rather than worrying. After 6-8 months, the feeling started to fade away after I focused on my potential improvement. I had peace with myself.

That is my story on how I overcome my impostor syndrome.

If you are going through this feeling. I hope you know you're not alone and it's normal. Researcher have estimated that 70% of the general population has experience this feeling at some point. 

The first step is to recognize what you feel, ask yourself what makes you uncomfortable. Articulate that explicitly on paper. A research suggest it's even better talk about it with someone you trust.<sup id="a2">[2](#fn2)</sup>

### Community discussion: Please share your story

Two days ago, I reached out to my [Twitter followers][tweet-1] and asked if anyone want to share how they overcome impostor syndrome in the past. A bunch of people told me their story, which I’ll share in the next blog post.

If you’re interested in sharing your own story, please [email me][email]. Whether you have overcome it or still working on it. I’d love to hear it in this structure:

- Describe how did you first recognize the feeling? What was the trigger?
- What was your approach to overcoming the feeling?
- What was the turning point that helped you overcome it? (If you haven't, skip this part)
