Design system is cool.

It was a hot topic – maybe it still is.

For startups, design system is won't be on the top priority. Especially if the startup is still looking for the product-market fit, the whole team should focus on that, discovering how to deliver value for the users to help gain momentum and hopefully have sustainable growth.

Business is ultimately about four things: Increase revenue, protect revenue, reduce cost, and avoid the cost.

Design system is mostly about reducing cost. It also avoids cost from the inefficiency of design debt and tech debt. But for a startup, the cost is not as high as a large tech company. So, consider holding the temptation to follow the cool kids on the block. Focus on what matters for your context.

So when would a startup start to consider a design system? What do you think?

*(P.S. If you've been waiting for the next impostor syndrome post, I'm still working on it.)*
