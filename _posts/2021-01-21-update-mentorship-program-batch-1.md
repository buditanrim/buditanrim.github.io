I'm impressed by 150 people who have signed up. Each has a unique story and challenge.

I have chosen 6 people for the full mentorship, but seeing 150 people who signed up with enthusiasm, I can't help but look for a way to help a larger number of people. So, here's the update:

- I will choose 20 people from students to mid-designers and offer a one-hour 1:1 session. If you're one of them, you'll get an email by the EOD of Friday, Jan 22nd.
- If you're not selected, don't worry, I'll create a small community for whoever signed up and see if we can do some exercise together to solve the problem at a larger scale together.

I have seen many communities out there. But most of them are for "everyone," and this is what I want to avoid. I want to have a small and close community that specifically shared challenges around the product and service design. Ultimately, the mission is to increase the impact of design by exchanging practice and learnings together.

So far, I imagine a small community where people with similar challenges can group and explore how to solve them together. I'll act as a facilitator to trigger some questions and perspectives. Hopefully, in the later stage, it can attract other senior people in the industry.
