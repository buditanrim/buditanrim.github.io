### What's for the rest?
Unfortunately, I only have so much time to offer for the community. However, I've been thinking to scale this up. Please stay tuned for more in the future. I don't want to hold a workshop or class format because it's not tailored, so I'm exploring some community-based activity. If you have any idea or want to collaborate, let me know!
