It's a wrong question.

The more appropriate question is, what does the product team do?

Because product designers shouldn't do things out in the wild alone, whatever we do should support the product team we're involved in. To understand what we do, we should first understand what the product team does.

So, let's start over. What does the product team do?

The product team doesn't deliver the product for the delivery's sake. The product team is in the business to make the value exchange happens. Giving the value to the customer and capturing the value to the business.

When the product helps customers accomplish their goals in a more meaningful way, customers receive value from the product.

Typically, as an exchange, the customer would pay a certain amount of money to the business, which is the value that the organization capture.

We're in the value exchange business.
