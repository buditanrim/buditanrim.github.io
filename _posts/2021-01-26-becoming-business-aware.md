"How can I make a greater impact?"

As you laddering up in your career, this question could linger in your head.

Suppose you are aspired to be a Principal Designer or leadership roles (e.g., Head of Design). In that case, you will be representing your team and need to articulate your team fits into the company goals. 

Despite if you are on the IC or managerial track, the business concept will open up a new perspective that will enable you to contribute better to the whole product development and company strategy.

When you communicate certain decisions, you'd need to let non-designers (product, business, data, tech) understand how that decision adds up to the larger company's objectives. This is where your business sense is important.

I was once impressed with one of the VP of Technology. He proposed a strategy and communicated its urgency by showing the cost saved for the company. After hearing his presentation, I thought, *wow, that’s a powerful pitch*. He understood how to connect all of his work to the business. And that enables him to influence the strategic shift in the company.

If you want to make a more significant impact, you should consider to appreciate the business concept and become more aware of it.
