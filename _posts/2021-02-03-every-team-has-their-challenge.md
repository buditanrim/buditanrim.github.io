Challenging situations.

Every design team has its own unique challenge.

That’s my takeaway from talking with 28 people from 6 small teams in Indonesia. 

They’re all different. Their environment. Their leaders. Their practice. How much trust the company put in the design team.

No matter where you work, there are always flaws in the organization. It's simple and obvious. But we often forget.

If you're facing a challenge. It's your choice. You can complain, or you can positively influence it. If you're going to influence a change, do it with patience.

Thanks to all the teams who spent an hour discussing with me!

> An insightful session! Budi didn’t just answer our questions, instead he tried to understand the context first (which helped us to frame and understand our problems better too!) He generously shared his experiences and provided practical advices.

If your team is interested in sitting and discussing together. Stay tuned for the next one, which I'll announce later on my Twitter.
