Challenging situations.

Every design team has its own unique challenge.

That’s my takeaway from talking with 28 people from 6 small teams in Indonesia. 

They’re all different. Their environment. Their leaders. Their practice. How much trust the company put in the design team.

No matter where you work, there are always flaws in the organization. It's simple and obvious. But we often forget.

If you're facing a challenge. It's your choice. You can complain, or you can positively influence it. If you're going to influence a change, do it with patience.

Thanks to all the teams who spent an hour discussing with me!
