Which one are you?

If you receive an order to execute the feature. Then, you're a feature-centered team. Your team is in the assembly line, serving the business but doesn't deliver value to the customers.

The alternative for that is a human-centered team. They learn about customers' needs, deliver value to them in the appropriate business constraint. To be clear. A human-centered product team doesn't ignore the business. They deliver a desirable solution for customers that viable for the organization.
