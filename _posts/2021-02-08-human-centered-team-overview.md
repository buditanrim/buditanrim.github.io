Which one are you?

If you receive an order to execute the feature. Then, you're a feature-centered team. Your team is in the assembly line, serving the business but doesn't deliver value to the customers.

The alternative for that is a human-centered team. They learn about customers' needs, deliver value to them in the appropriate business constraint. Meaning, the solution they deliver should be desirable for the users and works (viable) for the business.

Are you interested to turn your team to be a human-centered product team? In this series, I'll be focusing on how to drive this from bottom-up. I'm writing this specifically for design manager or anyone in the design leadership role who is struggle in a feature-centered team.

By the way, I'm not advocating a design-led team. I'm talking about a cross-function team. In this setting, product managers, business teams, engineers, data, and design collaborate closely. If you have a team in this format and struggle to stop the random feature request, then this series is for you.

First, let's build the [strategic relationship][link-1].
