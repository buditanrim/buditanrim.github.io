It's you.

You are responsible for your personal development.<br/>
Not your manager.<br/>
Not your parent.

No matter what's your title, you can't stop learning.<br/>
At least ask these questions for your growth:
- What do you feel you need to improve?
- What do you want to double down?

20 minutes is how long we usually can focus on the task. Try this:
- Break your work into smaller tasks
- Work on the task for 15 minutes
- Small break (2-3 min) & repeat

I've been doing this for a week, and it's been effective so far.
