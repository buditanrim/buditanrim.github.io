Being a design manager is characterized as "hands-off" role.

Producing outcome by enabling people.

It means you'll manage people, help them unblock the roadblock, and enable them to be successful.

Among many other important questions. The first question I normally ask is, "Have you satisfy your hunger in crafting and being on the front line?"

Being a manager meaning, you give the credits and spotlight to your team. To use the sports analogy, you'll be the coach on the sideline. The press and fans will focus on the player who scored. Only knowledgeable fans know the coach contributed to that. 

Managers with strong execution chops can better mentor designers through an ambiguous and challenging situation. If you don't have enough confidence about your craft, collaboration, and problem-solving skill. Imagine when your subordinates need guidance on how to handle their project. It's hard if you're not confident enough to be their thinking partner.

If you still hungry in your craft and execution. Looking for making the mark for your self-validation. Probably being a manager is not the path you need, at least not now.

Remember, this is only one question tho. 

But, normally, this first question makes designers pause.

Hope it resonates!
