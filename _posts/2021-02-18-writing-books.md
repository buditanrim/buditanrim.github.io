Probably too ambitious, but I have 3 books in mind.

The first one is for designers who want to get better at designing the user interface. It's not gonna be a gallery type of book for inspiration. You like to solve problems and thinking but have difficulty crafting the user interface? Or maybe you have an excellent visual judgment, but it is hard to rationalize why you make a specific design decisionâ€”this book targets those two conditions.

The second is for the design team who is interested in making design systems. It will describe practical and considerations to answer common questions I got about the design system. Like, when is the right time to build one? Should you have one? How to scale it if the company has multiple products targeting multiple users?

The last one will be for the product designer and product people who are interested in scaling the human-centered practice. To produce a better outcome, dealing with a business-centric environment.

My focus and energy will be for the first one, about the user interface. I have 2,000 words by far. Still a long way to go.

If you're struggling with the designing interface, [let me know][link-3], I wanna hear from you. That will be beneficial for me to understand the questions you have.
