Generic questions will trigger generic answers.

Specific questions will trigger particular answers.

Asking a generic question like, *what do you think?*

When you ask, *what do you think?* You actually ask, *based on your opinion, how would you interpret this design?* In which, more likely to trigger subjective opinions. It's okay if that's what you're looking for. However, if you're frustrated with vague or irrelevant feedback. Is there anything we can do? 

What if you can frame the discussion to focus on the intent behind the design? To discuss whether or not the artifact or the prototype you made so far achieve the intent. To do this, you need to frame a specific question to help the other person give more specific feedback.

Start by sharing the context. Share what the intention of the project is. Are you trying to communicate why people should choose your product over the competitor? Are you trying to help them get the task quickly? What is your design intent?

Share where you are now. Talk about a few approaches you have. What are you unsure about those approaches? Is there any part of your exploration that you don't like but need a pair of fresh eyes? If so, find the right person and get their perspectives.

Ask a specific question. Such as, "Knowing the objective and a few explorations I have shown. What can I improve to communicate the value proposition better?"

Be specific. Be articulate.
