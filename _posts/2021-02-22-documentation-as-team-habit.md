Documenting is a good habit to have as a team.

Many things can go wrong when you work on a project. When you go down the rabbit hole, you'll have hundreds of discussions and decisions.

First, it's a good realignment tool. I remember, after a meeting, I wrote down the discussion we made and the next action point. As soon as I show it to my team, we realized many of us interpret the discussion differently. Even though we have to go over the discussion all over again, it's better to be aware there is a misalignment in that point.

Second, it's good if your team wants to pick up the project again in the future. Scanning through the documentation, hopefully, can remind your team of the latest state of the project.
- What is the latest decision we made?
- Why we made that decision? Is there any data to back that up? 
- What is the constraint we faced?
- What are other options we intentionally ignore?

Document it, together with your team. Doing it alone will be less effective.
