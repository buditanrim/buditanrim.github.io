Uh, leadership? What do they do?

When a person said they're a design manager, or maybe they consider themselves in the leadership role. What do they actually do? Why their work seemingly invisible? What's their impact if the Individual Contributors do all the work?

Let's explore those questions in this series of product design leadership.
I want to do this differently. Instead of I prepare some outlines for this series, what if we actually collaborate?

You can send me <a href="mailto:hi.buditanrim@gmail.com?subject=Product Design Leadership">questions</a>, and then I'll choose them to be part of the series. Looking forward to hearing from you!
