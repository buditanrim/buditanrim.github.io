### 1.

In 1963, Ivan Sutherland from MIT first introducing graphics with his Sketchpad program and use a stylus-like to draw on the screen.

Ivan’s work was crucial.

To understand how important this milestone in computer history. Please open the terminal on your computer. Now, operate your computer only with that. Back then, that’s how people operate computers—type a command and execute it. But because of Ivan’s work, we now can enjoy a much better user interface.

The pen he uses then later becomes a mouse that we use. The concept of the window program is later explored by Xerox and Apple that are known as GUI.

School is not the only way to learn.<br>
Learning can come from anywhere.<br>
Learning from experience.<br>
Learning from people around you.<br>
Learning from reading.
Learning from yourself.

You just need to observe a bit more closely.

Don't write the features.<br>
Customers don't care about your feature.

Explain the benefits.<br>
Customers care what your feature can give them.
