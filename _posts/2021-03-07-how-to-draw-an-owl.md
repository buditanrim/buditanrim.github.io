Here's how to draw an owl.

No matter how stupid this guide looks. Perhaps, there is a message here.

I guess, the message is that people can show you the starting point and the end goal. But how to get there requires effort. It requires practice. Most importantly, it requires courage to try.

It takes time. No instant magic. You will not get better in one day. Maybe not in a week. We never know. But the point is not about the timeline. It's about the courage.

The courage to start practice and constantly learn.
