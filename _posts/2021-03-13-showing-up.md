Every 5am, I wake up and face the blank page.

I show up. I practice my writing.

My writings are sloppy. But I write anyway.

My blog could be better. But I put it out there anyway.

My portfolio is far from finished. But I published it anyway.

Perfection is getting in the way.

If I wait until everything is finished or perfect. I certainly will never publish my portfolio or write on my blog. Because perfect is not a good target. It gives us an excuseâ€”an excuse not to practice, not execute, and not make an impact.

Do it. Show up and practice. Face the hard part.
