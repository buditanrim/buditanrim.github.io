The more senior you become, the more opportunity for you to coach junior designers. Coaching is a generous act. You help others to grow. But for someone who do it for the first time, it can grow the insecurity.

This morning, a designer shared her insecurity with me. She has been coaching a young designer in her team, but she doesn't feel like she is good enough to be a coach.

"What's a good coach in your mind?" I asked.<br/>
"Calm, insightful, have the answer to most of the questions." She replied. <br/>
“Know all the answer?”<br/>
“Yeah, to help the junior designer know what to do when they stuck.” <br/>
“Well... Surely no one have all the answers.”<br/>
She laughed, then quickly added, “But, what should I do in that situation?”<br/>
“You can be the thinking partner,” I replied. “Acknowledge that you don’t know, then try to define the questions and figure it out together.”

Also, even if you have the answer. You don’t want to give everything away. You need to trigger them to think and experiment. It’s tempting to give the answer and finish off the job, but that doesn’t help them to grow because the next time they have a problem, they will come to you again. In the long run, your goal is to make the junior designer independent.

Your goal is to coach them on how to think. Not simply giving the answer. 

So, if you are coaching someone and sometimes don’t know the answer. Don’t feel bad about it. You are not a god, aren’t you? Just frame the question and learn the best way to answer it with them. Grow together.
