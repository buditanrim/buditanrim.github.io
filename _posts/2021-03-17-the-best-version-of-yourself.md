It was 2009. I was pursuing my accounting degree. I chose that because it was the cheapest option money-wise. When people asked about my aspiration, my answer would be to be a professional gamer.

I once had a team. But my team only won 2 tournaments and lost dozens of them. So, it didn't seem like a good future. There was no career in gaming at that time either.

Clearly, you know I'm not a professional gamer now. But the game did save my teen life. Not only it saved me from boredom, but it also taught me to be the best version of myself. To always practice with my team even we lost the game. It gave me a sense of purpose while I struggle to understand what's my future look like.

Some of you are probably trying to figure out what's next for you in your life. Same with me, I don't have any idea what's next for me. But I know I want to be the best version of myself whenever I can. My book had around 8.000 words. But it wasn't as good as I wanted. This morning, I had to scrap it all over again. Start over from square one. I learned that having an outline is necessary so I don't write myself to the corner.

Was that a failure? No. It's the practice. The practice to be the best version of myself. Was that frustrating? Yes. But, I trust my practice.

What do you do to be the best version of yourself?
