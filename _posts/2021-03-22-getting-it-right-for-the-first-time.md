Why should you?

If Ernest Hemingway, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Pablo Picasso could not get it right the first time, what makes you think that you will? â€” Paul Heckel

One of the mindsets I always foster is to dare to experiment. The first try is the hardest. But you have to try. Once you made your first mistake, use it to be better next time.

That's the beauty of being a human being. You grow and get better.
