Most professional has an ultimate award as a prize for success.

For F1 drivers, it’s a trophy.

For pro boxers, it’s the belt.

For NBA players, it’s a championship ring.

What about product designers? Is it when our product winning an award? What is the equivalent of trophy for us?

Imagine if it’s 4 a.m., you want to got up to go to the bathroom, and suddenly you faint and land face-first on the bathroom floor. No one hears your fall. You are bleeding. That’s the story of Toralv Østvang in February 2019. Fortunately, he wore his Apple Watch, and the paramedics immediately took him to a nearby hospital. He suffered three fractures to his face. 

Our work is not about winning. Product design is a generous craft. We serve people and make their life better. In my view, the reward of our effort is when we see people’s lives better, like the story from Toralv.

What’s your concept of success in your career?
