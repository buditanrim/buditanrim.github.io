Modern product design principles :)

- **Aim for consistency at any cost.** Don't reinvent the wheel. Just reuse whatever your design system provides and plug it into your design. Plus, you don't have to argue and save your cognitive load for zoom fatigue (_and Clubhouse_).

- **Be efficient when designing.** Don't waste time analyzing the user's goal and tasks. Just create one artifact and then work on another to-do list. Your business needs to move fast. Be quick, time is money!

- **Make it incredibly beautiful.** Put gradient, big text, and bold color. People don't read anyway. People are willing to buy and use the product that is beautiful even when it's useless.

- **Be friendly.** When the error occurs, write something friendly like, "Uh, oh!" In fact, it is _really_ friendly and people love it because playfulness reduces their stress level.

- **Appreciate the intelligence of your users.** They are human beings. Most of them are educatedâ€”formally or informally. Don't provide obvious feedback. They know what's happening.

- **Make people remember things.** Put a voucher code on one page, then let the users remember the code and later type it during checkout. Your users love challenges.
