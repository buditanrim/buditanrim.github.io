Don’t confuse yourself with various techniques in the industry. Design sprint, design thinking, agile, scrum—those are the How to. Focus at your core.

Let’s get back to the basics first. What do you do as a product designer? Product team exist to deliver value to the customers. To do that, we answer these three core questions: 

1. Who are we serving?
2. What problem do they have?
3. What’s the best solution we can make to solve that problem differently?

Those techniques might provide you ways to answer those three big questions. But shouldn't be your focus.

There are many other questions, like how do we monetize? or how do we build it? But those questions aren't relevant until you get this core question.
