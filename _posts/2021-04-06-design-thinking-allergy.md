"In a traditionally managed organization, the introduction of design thinking will lead to conflict," André Schaminée pointed out in his book, _Designing With—in Public Organizations_.

When I read, it resonates.

It was one of the big mistakes I’ve made. I was too obsessed with design thinking. I want to prove the value, and throughout the process of doing that, I kept using the term: design thinking.

Guess what. People are allergic to this term. 

First, it has “design” in it. So, you exclude people from the non-design team. _But Design is about planning. So, everyone is actually doing that. After all, everyone is a designer, right?_ That's my ego speaking by the way. If no one is in the same frequency with me, what's the point? It’s impossible to make a change. 

Second, it has “thinking” in it, making it worse because it sends out a signal that only designers can think.

After a few months, we sent out the first email to the company-wide as an effort to evangelize this practice. I decided to put “Small wins—customer story” on the subject. The email reflects how the practice can produce a dramatic impact on the business. I do mention “human-centered practice,” but I left out the word design and also thinking.

I'm glad I did that. 

People become more receptive. 

We got our first traction. Many people from the non-design team started to reach out more and more. 

Leading a change is not easy. Our ego, sometimes, gets in the way.

P.S. I will send out the first exclusive newsletter for all subscribers this Thursday, we'll discuss some questions from the readers there :) You peeps are awesome! Thanks for all the support.
