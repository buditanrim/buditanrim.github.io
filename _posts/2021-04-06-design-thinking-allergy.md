"In a traditionally managed organization, the introduction of design thinking will lead to conflict," André Schaminée pointed out in his book, _Designing With—in Public Organizations_.

When I read, it resonates.

It was one of the big mistakes I’ve made. I was too obsessed with design thinking. Throughout the process of implementing it, I kept using the term: design thinking.

Guess what. People are allergic to this term. 

First, it has “design” in it. So, you exclude people from the non-design team. Second, it has “thinking” in it, making it worse because it sends out a signal that only designers can think.

After a few months, we sent out the first email to the company-wide as an effort to evangelize this practice. I decided to put “Small wins—customer story” as the subject. The email reflects how the practice can produce a dramatic business impact in one team. I do mention “human-centered practice,” but I left out the word design and also thinking.

I'm glad I did that.

People become more receptive. 

We got our first traction.

Many people from the non-design team started to reach out more and more. 

Leading a change is not easy. Our ego, sometimes, gets in the way. So, if you're obsessed with any terms, perhaps you should reorient to what matters?
