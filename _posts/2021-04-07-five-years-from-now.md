Day after day. Month after month.

We work. We do our routines. Cross out that to-do list.

Shouldn’t we cool down a bit?

Pausing is as important as doing.

If you have a minute, let’s explore this simple question: What’s your aspiration for the next 5 years? 

I used to hate this question. Not everyone can answer it right away. But, it’s a good question to think of from time to time. Your answer can change too. It’s part of the discovery. The point of this question is not to predict but is to orient. As you move forward, you can slightly turn left or right.

If 5 years seems too far away, what about three years? Or next year?

Have fun with your dream.
