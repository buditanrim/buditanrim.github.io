Consider everything an experiment. 

That mindset removes the worry of failing. Because it’s an experiment, after all. It’s an attempt to answer the questions you have. Even if the experiment produces a different result from your expectation. You will learn.

For example, if you are afraid to facilitate a workshop. See it as an experiment. Convert that fear into questions. From “I’m afraid if people don’t understand my instruction” to “How would I communicate the instruction clearly?”

If you never take action, you will never get any feedback on your attempts. Without feedback, you will never grow. The idea you have in your head is an idea.

See everything you do as an experiment.
