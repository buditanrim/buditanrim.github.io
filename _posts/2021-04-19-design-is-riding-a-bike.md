I can teach you how to wrap a gift. Step by step instruction will do.

I can’t teach you how to ride a bike, though. It’s a more complex activity than gift-wrapping.

Riding a bike requires coordination between your cognitive, motor, and visual. First, you deal with the worry of falling off the bike. Then, you need to practice your pedaling skill. And, finally, you should control the handlebar and the brake.

Design is pretty much like that.

I can tell you how to move the pedal, but it’s an incomplete skill.

I can tell you how to press the brake, but you’ll squeeze it too much initially.

Design requires you to practice. Fall a few times is part of the practice.
