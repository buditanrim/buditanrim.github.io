Of course, it does. It suits your personal taste.

It’s enough to satisfy your personal taste if you make something for yourself. 

It’s enough if you want to exercise.

It’s enough because it’s for you.

But to ship the experience that matters for people. Your personal opinion is not enough. Your decision should focus on the people you serve—your users.
