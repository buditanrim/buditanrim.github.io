When the project failed, our brain naturally seek an explanation. 

Our natural response is to blame others or the circumstances.

It's easy to blame the situation or others. On the other hand, it's too painful to look at our mistakes. This is called a blame bias.

If you're working in the team format. This attitude will hinder you and your team from progressing. Whenever there's a mistake or a failure, you should learn from it. Do retrospect with open-mindedness and get better together.

You are part of the team. 

Don't be a blamer.

Learn from experience and be a team player.
