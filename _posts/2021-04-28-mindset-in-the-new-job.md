When you try to prove yourself.

It brings out ego because your self-image is at stake. 

You'll put pressure for yourself.

That's not a good mindset to start a new job. 

It’s better to learn.

Learning to allow you to ask questions. To gain knowledge.

Understand that you don’t know a lot of things. Be proactive to gain the context. Get yourself up to speed. Then contribute. Make an impact with the team.

In your first 30 days, try to understand the landscape:

Where is my team going? What's our vision?

Where is my team now? 

What are our challenges?

Who are the people I'll work with?
