We only have an hour to work on the academic test.

We only have a few seconds to answer the teacherâ€™s question.

Everything is timed. Our education system implicitly ingrained that slow thinking and doubt are undesirable. Fast is somehow appreciated.

We become reluctant to stop and think. To question assumptions or to challenge the dogma. As a result, many people want to make a quick decision. Even though quick is not necessarily accurate.

When we hear people say, "Because X says so." Perhaps, we can learn to question that statement in our life.
