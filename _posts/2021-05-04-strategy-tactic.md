I know—it’s confusing, these words are used interchangeably. 

But let me share a simple model.

Let's say you have an objective to lose weight. 

You need a strategy like consume fewer calories (diet) and exercise. Those are strategies. They are not stating when and how specifically you’ll exercise. They are the levers to help us to achieve the change we seek to make.

Then, the tactics for exercise could be: hiking, go to the gym, swimming. The tactics for diet could be the paleo diet, vegan diet, low-carb diets, or Dukan diet. Tactics are the activities you can do to make the strategy come to life.

That is a simplification of strategy and tactic. You need to strategize in almost anything. When you do a meeting, what’s your strategy to make it effective? When you work on the product, what’s your strategy to increase its chance to be successful?
