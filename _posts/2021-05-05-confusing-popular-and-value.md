Popular doesn’t necessarily mean good.

Popular is well-known.

What’s good is what valuable for you.

What’s well-known is not necessarily valuable for you.

Suppose you want to apply a design system because it’s well-known. That’s not a good mindset to begin. Does it valuable for your team? If so, what value would you create from creating a design system?

It doesn’t make sense to make something just because it’s popular.

It’s pretty lazy.
