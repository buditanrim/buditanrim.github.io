People want a humidifier, but what they need is to control the room’s humidity.

People want a headphone, but what they need is to listen to the music privately.

People want a luxury watch, but what they need is prestige.

People normally express what they want. But our job is to figure out what they really need. Then, together with the team, we have to figure out the best solution for that need.

Train yourself to be more sensitive when you hear a specific feature or a specific solution. That might be the “want” but not the fundamental needs.
