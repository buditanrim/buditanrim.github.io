Joking too much, people don't take you seriously.

Talking too much, people get tired of you.

Loving yourself too much, you become a narcissist.

Thinking too much, you don't get things done.

'Too much is the keyword. It's excessive.

Too little is also ineffective.

As you developing your skill, this rule of thumb would help you. Ask yourself: Are you too obsessed with one thing over the other?

Itâ€™s all about balance.

Of course, you learn one thing at a time. But, don't treat that one thing as everything.
