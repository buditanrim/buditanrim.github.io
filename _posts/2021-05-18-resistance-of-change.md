When you make a new product, you propose a change.

You come to the market and say, "Here's something better. Consider switching to it."

If you make a new TV, you ask people to change from their old one.

If you create a new messaging platform, you ask people to change from their current one. 

Change is complicated. Just because your product is better, it doesn't mean people will switch to it. In the messaging example, the users might wonder if their friends will use the same platformâ€”it creates resistance to change.

How could you design for this change?

One element to consider is to accommodate the change. For example, Google Pixel provides a way to transfer data from iPhone. That is not going to solve everything, but it's one consideration to ease the change.

As a product designer, this is something you should collaborate with the product manager. Consider the potential resistance.
