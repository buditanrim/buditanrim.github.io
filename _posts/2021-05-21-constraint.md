The blank canvas is inviting. But it can be paralyzing.

The emptiness creates the opportunity for you to create anything you want. Yet, at the same time, it overwhelms us with so many options. 

Constraint might be frustrating. But without it, we can be paralyzed. A constraint is necessary. In fact, it exists in many ways.

Time constraint.

Budget constraint.

Knowledge constraint.

The point is not to be frustrated with the constraints. But to be aware of them and dance with them.

What is the constraint you and your team face? How could you work with it?
