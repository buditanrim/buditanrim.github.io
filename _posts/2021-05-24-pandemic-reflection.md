There are always two sides to the coin.

Pandemic is probably the worst thing that has happened to us so far.
Here’s the thing, though. It’s already happened—no point in being frustrated about it.

It’s probably one chance in a lifetime for us to rethink our lifestyle. During this time, we spend less time commuting and socializing. To rethink how we should use our time.

Perhaps this is an opportunity for us to shape our lifestyle for the better. As design practitioners, we could iterate our life for an improvement.

What are things you took for granted before the pandemic?

What are things you didn’t miss during the pandemic?

What are new routines you have developed during the pandemic you want to keep doing?
