_Should I quit?_ I thought as I sit on the bus on my way to work.

I had a good salary. The team was lovely. New York was a fun city.

_Why do I feel stuck?_

I designed the marketing campaign, coded the HTML newsletter, or tweaked a small part of the feature. I learned something new on my job, but why did I feel not grow?

I noticed I had enough money in my saving for six months. 

The week after that, I decided to quit. When the CEO asked me why I couldn’t explain it, I left the secured job to be a full-time freelancer.

Looking back, I’m glad I did it because the only reason to stay was the money. But money was probably not a good aim.

If we pursue something too materialistic: money, fame, or attention—it can slow us down. It distracts us from what matters the most in our stage of apprenticeship: learning. Learning is what we should prioritize when we still in the early of our career. Without it, we can’t reach the next level.

Early in our career, we go through this apprenticeship phase—where we observe the condition, practice it, and continuously experiment through trial and error.

Throughout my freelance time, I learned a lot. I took an illustration class. I made my icon as a way to practice what I love. Combining preparation with a bit of luck, Yahoo contacted me. It led me to one thing after another.

We learn differently. But, here's the most important question for you: Do you learning and growing in your current role? If so, what is it? If not, what would be the best action to achieve learning?
