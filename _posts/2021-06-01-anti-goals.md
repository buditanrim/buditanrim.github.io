How can you be more productive?

That’s tough to answer. But, if you invert that into: What are things that make me NOT productive and how do I avoid it? Suddenly, it becomes easier to answer. 

Tricky questions occur when we don’t know _yet_ what the answer would be. We don’t know _yet_ what best practice there is. We don’t know _yet_ what we want to accomplish.

This is where anti-goals will be useful. It’s a guiding principle that you can use to be less wrong. As Charlie Munger, the close partner of Warren Buffet, advocated the idea to inverse a problem:

“Problems frequently get easier if you turn them around in reverse. In other words, if you want to help India, the question you should ask is not ‘how can I help India,’ it’s ‘what is doing the worst damage in India and how do I avoid it?” 

*

For example, instead of describing the perfect scenario on how to have a productive day, you define the barriers and blockers:

- Constantly checking Twitter on my mobile phone
- Packed calendar all-day long
- Taking a long time to start my day

Then you convert them into anti-goals:
- Never put my phone close to me when working
- Never schedule more than four meetings in a day
- Never going to sleep before planning for the next day

You can expand the concept to any aspect of your life and work. You can easily start this by having a discussion with your team. So, what are your anti-goals?
