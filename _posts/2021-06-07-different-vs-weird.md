Different is not the same as another. Weird is strange in a frightening way.

Voicing a unique opinion is being different.

Unwilling to change your mind is weird.

Steph Curry, the basketball player for the Golden State Warriors, shot the ball differentlyâ€”which become his strength. Being different can be your strength.

In school, we learn the same things, in the same space and pace. We try to fit in with the others. In the real world, fitting in might not be the most important aspect to be successful.
