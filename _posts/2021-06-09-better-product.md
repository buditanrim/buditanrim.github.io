I once worked on a project. We build an app to empower low-middle income people to have better bookkeeping for their shops. But is it better?

Better for us, maybe. But the shop owners have been doing their bookkeeping on paper for years. Writing the number on the paper is much simpler than typing it on the application. Besides, it’s already become their habit.

This is a problem for people who make products—everyone seems to have a good idea of the “ideal” state. They talk about how great it is if the user uses the product. But that is a big IF. 

People have their current workaround and we should appreciate this. But, unfortunately, some people are too obsessed with their idea and it blinds them from reality, leading to unsuccessful work.

If your team can’t honestly answer, “Why would the customers crave our product?” It’s a recipe for disappointment.
