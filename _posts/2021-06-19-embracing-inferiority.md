*What am I doing here?*

*The team will be doing just fine without me.*

*I’m not making any impact.*

*I feel small.*

Those are not the right mindset. When you enter the industry or when you take a bigger role. You’re learning. You are in the apprenticeship phase. 

You’re not there to perform. You’re there to learn. 

Will your team do just fine without you? Perhaps. But that doesn’t matter. To optimize your apprenticeship phase, you should embrace the feeling of inferiority—to accept that others will know more than you.

Exploring a new role with the inferiority feeling is much better than feeling superior. Because when we think we’re good and superior, we don’t absorb. Hence, we don’t learn.
