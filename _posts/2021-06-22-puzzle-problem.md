A puzzle is complex, but it’s not hard because it has one correct answer. You get all the pieces, and you know the goal. You just need to put an effort.

A problem is wicked. It’s uncertain. There are many solutions to solve the problem—some are effective, and some are not. You don’t get all the relevant information you need to solve the problem. Often, the goal is fuzzy and not well articulated.

If we’re all dealing with real-world problems in our profession, how could we expect not to fail at all?
