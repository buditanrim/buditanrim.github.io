No pair of eyes can see everything in the world.<br/>
No pair of ears can hear everything in the world.<br/>
No pair of hands can touch everything in the world.<br/>
One mind cannot possibly comprehend and understand everything there is to know.

We're all grasp pieces of reality, but it's an incomplete reality. This is precisely we should be critical with our reasoning and be open-minded with a different view.

Often in our profession, we have a discussion with the team to make a decision. We might be in a situation where we have a disagreement, which creates an unsettling emotional reaction in our brain. But that disagreement can be a healthy process if both parties can be open-minded and always willing to reassess their thinking.
