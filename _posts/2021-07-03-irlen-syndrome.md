A black text (#000000) on top of white background (#ffffff) has a 21:1 contrast ratio—which the highest contrast ratio.

For some people, such high contrast creates visual stress. The symptoms are perceptual distortion such as blurring, duplication, a flickering of the visual stimulus—known as Irlen syndrome.

According to the American psychologist Helen Irlen, this condition would interest approximately 12-14% of the population and about 46% of individuals with dyslexia. It can impair reading acquisition.

Next time you design, this seemingly small decision on color would help many people have a comfortable reading experience.
