A good interface is obvious for people. It’s obvious when…

1. People understand it. They can comprehend the information they’re seeing—or hearing or feeling (for blind people).
2. People know what to do.
3. People know they’re making progress toward their goals.

You should achieve those three basic criteria of obviousness. Otherwise, it can create frustration for the users. To improve your interface design, step back and ask these three questions:

- Who are the users and what is their goal? 
- Will the users know what to do here?
- Will the users know they’re making the right progress toward their goal? 

The goal is for you to walk through your design. Keep in mind the task or the goal. Then ask the second and third questions as you move on to every step.

For example, is it plausible that the user will know how to find the support page? And if so, how obvious is it? Once they click on the link toward the support page, does the next page give the appropriate information scent to help them know they're making the right progress?

These can help you to be more thoughtful, identify some potential improvement even before putting it in front of the users for testing it out. 

_These questions are inspired by the Cognitive Walkthrough designed by Wharton et al. (1994). I modified it a little bit to make it easier and practical to use on a daily basis._
