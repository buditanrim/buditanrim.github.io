Poor thinkers spend a few minutes here and thereâ€”they get distracted. They get the gist of the problem and make a quick decision. They feel the urge to get the job done quickly. 

Good thinkers stick with one problem or question long enough. They dig into the problem, draw connections, and make a deep analysis of the potential options. 

Poor thinking may be quick, but it leads to a flawed decision. Good thinking is hard, but it gives you less trouble in the future.
