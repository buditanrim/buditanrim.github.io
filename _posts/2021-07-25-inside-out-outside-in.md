Consider this how might we statement, “How might we increase the retention rate?” This statement is written with an inside-out mindset, it cares about the internal team’s problem, not the consumer's.

Many people adopt frameworks but using this inside-out mindset. Then things don’t work out, and they blame the frameworks, “Oh, what a bullshit hype thing. I tried it and it's useless.”

A framework is a way of thinking to deal with a specific situation effectively. But if you use an inside-out mindset, it’s a guarantee for failure.

When you come across a framework, dig deeper. Understand why the author created it in the first place.

Stay curious.
