The ringing sound on my head was horrible last week. I had to stop my reading and writing ritual altogether. This symptom, Tinnitus, has many causes. I have a slight hearing loss in a high frequency that possibly causes this symptom.

It's getting better tho. I use sound therapy to reduce it. This morning I almost hear no ringing. Hopefully, it's not a permanent thing.

Speaking of hearing, consider reduce using headphones. Make sure the volume stays below 40% to prevent any hearing loss if you really need to use it.

Last week, I reflected on my blog and how I can engage with you better. I feel my blog serves me well as a tool to reflect and share ideas with you. But I crave something more specific.

Next month, I hope to release one short book. For example, it can be very specific for people who recently enter the product design industry. In it, we can discuss things like What to focus on in the first 6 months? What are common pitfalls to avoid?

So, if you are in that stage and have any questions, please send me a question with enough context. I might incorporate it.

I'm excited about this.
