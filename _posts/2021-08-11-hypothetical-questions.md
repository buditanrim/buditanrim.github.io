Do you want a hamburger with low-fat beef?

That is a hypothetical question.

Posing any hypothetical questions to customers is rarely helpful. Why? Because human is terrible at predicting their future behaviorsâ€”known as a psychological distance.

The launch of the McLean Deluxe by McDonald's in the 1990s can serve as an example. Their executives make a decision based on the polls indicating that nearly nine out of 10 consumers were willing to try low-fat beef.

Imagining something and experience it is totally two different things. When we imagined something, we tend to focus on the desirability and why we want them. 

On the other hand, when we try something, we focus on the details and assess how we will use them.

The principle here is to avoid hypothetical questions and ground your observation based on the reality, unless you have a specific intention.
