We only hear what we want to hear.

We only see what we want to see.

When we have a belief, we like to confirm that belief because it gives us the illusion of control. Our brain is twice as likely to notice confirming information than it is to notice disconfirming information.

This confirmation bias can lead to a bad decision. Some example scenarios:
- You draw a conclusion from a vanity metric. Because the bounce rate is right, you believe that the page need to be redesigned.
- You only listen to the users you agree with
- You stop the A/B testing as soon as you get the result you want

#### Something to practice

**Write down contradicted information.** Charles Darwin famously uses this technique. When he found any information that contradicted his previous convictions, he would write it down. The reason is to let it sink. Otherwise, our minds would reject the evidence.

**Consider the opposite.** In the 1980s, psychologist Charles Lord suggested writing down your assumptions and ask yourself, what if my assumptions are wrong? What if the opposite is true?

**Always look for contrary information.** Make it easier for people to disagree with you. Open up the discussion by explicitly invite people to challenge your view. It's okay to be opinionated, but don't be stubborn.
