We complain about bad meetings. 

But what if we can improve the meeting continuously?

End your meeting with a reflection for continuous improvement. 

When everything is still fresh, solicit the input from the team members. Here are a few examples of the reflection questions you can use by the end of the meeting:

- How clear was the meeting agenda? 
- How well did we distribute the time for each agenda time?
- How well did we allocate time for decision-making? 
- How well did everyone stay on topic?
- How effective was the process? 

Collect the input and commit to the improvement needed for your next meeting.
