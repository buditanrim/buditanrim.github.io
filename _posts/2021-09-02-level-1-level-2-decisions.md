Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, made an interesting hierarchy of decisions. He introduced the idea of Level 1 and level 2 decisions.

Level 1 decision is hard to reverse. In contrast, a Level 2 decision is easy to reverse.

Bezos argues that when we deal with Level 1 decisions, we need to be [slow and cautious](https://buditanrim.co/2021/slow-thinker/). However, we should move fast and not wait for perfect data when making Level 2 decisions. In level 2 decision, we'll learn more by trying and doing.
