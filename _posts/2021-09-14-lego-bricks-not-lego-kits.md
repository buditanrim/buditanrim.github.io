LEGO kits are different from the classic LEGO bricks.

If you buy LEGO kits, you can only make a specific thing.

If it's a Batman theme, you'll end up with Batman and his car. But you know precisely what to build before you open the package.

LEGO bricks are different. It gives you a starting point. You can build anything you can imagine, and it doesn't prescribe you.

When building a design system, we don't want to provide LEGO kits. Instead, we want to provide LEGO bricks. 

We want to enable designers to use the components critically and continually improve the outdated
LEGO bricks. Or it is even better if designers can add new LEGO bricks when we realize there is a
missing piece.

I've written a longer thinking in my Medium, read [Design System: LEGO Kits syndrome](https://uxdesign.cc/design-system-lego-kits-syndrome-b5fe6a6ca53e)
