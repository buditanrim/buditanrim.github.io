We consume an experience when we work. But did we learn anything?

We make mistakes or try something new. But if we never reflect and process the experience, we never consciously learn.

For me, the most important thing is to reflect after you had done a project.  I do this while I take a "vacation."

In my recent project, for example, I needed to align multiple leaders to build the strategy for 2022. Throughout the process, I built a few frameworks based on my experience and reading materials. 

Sometimes, I instinctually did something because it felt right. For example, to align everyone with such an abstract concept around strategy. I prepared a visual document in Miro. Then I share it asynchronously to explain the approach we'll use throughout the process.

When I reflect, I find myself thinking, *Oh, what I did here was effective. What was the thinking I had that time? How can I replicate this next time?*

This reflection helps me to be aware of my subsconscious decision. So that, next time, I can be more intentional in the similar situation.

Try it. Take a day off after a big project.

Reflect with no distractionâ€”walk through the project from beginning to current. Then you can say, "Wow, I learned a lot."
