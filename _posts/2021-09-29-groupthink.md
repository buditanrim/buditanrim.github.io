We're social creatures. We avoid disrupting harmonies in the group.

That's a psychological phenomenon called Groupthink.

Study shows people easily get influenced and feel the social pressure to agree with each other. As a result, the group will come up with tunnel-vision ideas. Groupthink destroys creative thinking and divergent thinking.

The alternative?

If you want to generate diverse ideas together with the team, prepare a set of trigger questions.

Give time for everyone to think through the problem individually. Then regroup and inspire each other.

If necessary, break out again.

This way, people have to think through their reasoning first. You'll get a diverse output.
