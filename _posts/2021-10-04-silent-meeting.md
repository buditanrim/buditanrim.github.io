I tried many things to improve the team's effectiveness while working remotely. One of them is conducting a silent meeting.

The concept of silent meetings spread out from Amazon's culture.

In the first 10-15 minutes, the room is silent. Everyone read prepared documentation. This format eliminates the ineffectiveness of traditional meetings, such as no specific agenda, lousy presentation, or the loudest voice getting to talk.

Silent meetings enable people to digest the information. It encourages people to comment and voice their questions. 

Moreover, it helps whoever is in charge of the project to reflect in the writing format. By doing that, we have a more focused discussion.

A silent meeting fits with our values and our culture. We're planning to continue using it.

Of course, not all meetings can be a silent meetings. I still have the unstructured meeting here and there. But a majority of the meeting should start in silence.
