Every team has its own culture. The dynamic, the way of working, and the people in the team come from different experiences.

The team should choose how they work together. If you want to do a daily standup, go ahead. If you need more transparent accountability and want to use DARCI, go ahead.

It sounds messy, but everyone can figure the practice that fits their team's dynamic.

Then, we have a concept of cross-pollination. A team will share if a specific method works, and other teams could adopt it.

Cross-pollination is respecting the context over consistency. It doesn't mandate people to work in a certain way. If you're leading teams, consider cross-pollination.

To start, you want to provide a space for people to share what works. Have a conversation with other leaders. For example, the team can share what works during a town hall.
