Ideas are useless if your team doesn't [align][1].

Have your team aligned? 

If not, you're in big trouble because everyone thinking about different thing. It slows you down from making meaningful progress.

You should at least align on two things. It's the bare minimum.

The first one is to align on the status quoâ€”the current state of the problem. If your team's mission is to improve children's mental health, which specific problem to solve? What about the current situation that you seek to change?

The second one is to align on the desired outcome. Based on the current state of the problem, how the better future do we envision? Why is that better? Based on what?

If your team can frame these two things and then continuously iterate as you pick up new knowledge. You'll be okay.
