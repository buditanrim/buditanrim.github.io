makes things more manageable!

Set a weekly goal with your team. Sit together and reflect:

- What's our goal this week?
- What actions do we need to do to accomplish that?
- Who's going to be responsible for which?

The goal of this week should represent the desired state. For example: by the end of this week, we agreed on the metrics to track and a roadmap.

The action is the activity you should do to accomplish the goal. It can be a workshop or someone dedicates time to synthesize the thinking or preparing a storyboard.

Now, the most important part. Who's going to be in charge? Who's going to lead?
