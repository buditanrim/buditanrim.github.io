A researcher just talked to three users and came back with an insight. Assuming there is no misconduct, should the team listen to it?

The research finding is an interpretation of reality. 

Here's the thing. The research finding is essential in design, but it does not tell you the whole reality. It's simply an interpretation based on the source we see. We would never fully understand the complete reality because we only observed or experienced a portion of the reality. Therefore, we have blind spots.

To combat the blind spots, we can triangulate multiple sources of data.

Denzin (1978) defined triangulation as "the combination of methodologies in the study of the same phenomenon."

Your team will get cross-verification from two or more sources. The researchers then can look for patterns and develop an interpretation that is more representative of reality. The typical approach is to combine quantitative data collection with qualitative observation.

Should you listen to the insights based on the three users?

Well, you could. But you should be aware that only gives you a portion of the reality. With the limitation and constraints you have, it might be the best option you have. 

Triangulate if you could.
