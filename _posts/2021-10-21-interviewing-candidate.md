Last week, I interviewed ten candidates. Phew.

Typically, I begin by asking the candidate's life story. I'm trying to assess their worldview. Also, how enjoyable the way they tell the story. I love this part because I can always learn something new.

Then comes the critical part.

Right after I ask the candidate a few questions, I give them space to ask me questions.

One of the qualities that I look at in the candidate is how good their questions are.

I believe how well they ask questions indicates how much they know. For example, if someone asks me: what's the company objective for 2022? Then, I take that as a signal.

A signal that the candidate might know something about strategy. Moreover, if she gives me another good follow-up question, I take that as a strong signal.

There are 20 aspects we pay attention to during the interview. Asking a good question is one of them.

To be clear, it's not so much about how you articulate the question with crisp and precise words. It's about the thinking behind that question. When I'm unsure about it, I ask the candidate, _why did you ask that question?_

My advice is to ask questions during your work continually. Reflect often. It's a continuous practice.
