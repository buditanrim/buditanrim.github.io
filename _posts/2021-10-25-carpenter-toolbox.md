Designers and carpenters are comparable. Both have a toolbox.

Carpenters will pull the hammer out to smash a nail. They'll use a tape measure when they need a precise measurement. You get the point.

Designers have a lot of tools too. But different kinds of tools.

We use methods to help us construct and structure abstractions. For example, we can map out the stakeholder relationship to help us understand the dynamic and conflicting agendas.

We use a mental model to help us analyze a certain situation quickly. For example, when we face an ambiguous situation and it's impossible to articulate the goal, we use anti-goals.

We use a framework like a build-test-learn to help the team understand the way of working. This framework creates a mental shortcut to help us navigate our project.

We have rituals, like design critique, to enable everyone to give inputs.

I believe that great design practitioners have a rich toolbox. Many of our tools are invisible, but they're powerful if you can start collecting them consciously.
