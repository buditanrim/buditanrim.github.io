Many team discussions went vague along the way. It's a common issue.

Perhaps because our brain does a leap of abstraction<sup id="a1">[1](#fn1)</sup> and everyone starts to have a different idea along the way.

Lately, I have tried to tackle this. During the team discussion, I'd open up Miro and share my screen. Then, whenever a team member talks, I capture her point in a post-it. 

If someone else responds to it, I create another post-it and connect it horizontally. If someone suddenly jumped into a different topic, I made another row.

Here's what is interesting about this discussion treemap. Each row has to end up with an actionable conclusion.

When everyone agrees on the discussion, we mark it as done and write the conclusion. This way, we can share it with the broader team.

If we still need follow-up activity or questions,  we'll write the next step and point the person in charge.

We can complain about a lot of things, but we have agency to make it better. If you feel the discussion is fuzzy in your team, consider discussion treemap.
