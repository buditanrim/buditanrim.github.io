In school, we focus on getting a good grade. Suddenly, answering the question becomes the most important goal. 

The teacher already set the question, so we take it and focus on answering it.

We no longer question the question.

In our journey to solve a problem, we have a lot of questions. Perhaps, we should take a pause and ask ourselves, what is this question for?

Maybe it will lead you to a better question.
