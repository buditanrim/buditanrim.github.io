Lately, I've been thinking. What should I keep in mind during the dialogue or debate?

Suppose a person throws a thought. What can I do to quickly and accurately respond?

So, I looked around and found the old-good Socratic questioning. But I modified it and came up with a mental model. Whenever a person articulates a thought, I would probe one of these:

- Problem and root cause:
    + What's problem are we solving here? 
    + Why? What causes that?
- Implication
    + If that's true, so what?
    + What is the implication of this?
- Viewpoints
    + Does anyone agree/disagree?
    + What do you think of this (contradicting view)?
- Reasoning, evidence: 
    + What led you to that conclusion?
    + How do we know if that's true? 
- Assumptions: 
    + Is that an assumption? 
    + Do we have a belief that (X)?
- Questions
    + What was the point of asking that question?

I can't wait to experiment with this model.
