A team celebration can be a blunder, if...

The leader frame the team's achievement as if they've finished the race. This can give people too much pride. We should remind people about our long-term vision so no one lose sight of it.

The team celebrates the output instead of the actual impact itself. This can lead to a false sense of accomplishment. Worse, this can create culture of output-driven instead of [outcome-focused][1].
