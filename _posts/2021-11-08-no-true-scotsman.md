People normally generalize things. For example, Japanese people are very clean.

Then, when the opposite evidence appears, people tend to dismiss it and protect their generalization.

It's a fallacy known as "No true Scotsman." Here's an example:

A: No Scotsman puts sugar in their coffee.

B: My uncle is a Scotsman, and he puts sugar in his coffee.

A: Your uncle must not be a true Scotsman!
