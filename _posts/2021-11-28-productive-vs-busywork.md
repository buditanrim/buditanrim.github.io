Both take a lot of your time.

It's easy to drown in the list of tasks. When you're "busywork," you don't necessarily bring meaningful value to the team. You are just doing your job.

Productive work is different.

Productive work is about prioritizing. That means you say no to something so you can say yes to something meaningful. Take a step back and ask yourself, "What is the value I need to bring to the team?"

Now, set a goal for this week. By the end of this week, you want___.  Fill the blank with outcomes. What action do you want your team to take? What mindset do you want to plant to the team? Is there any important discussion that needs to happen?

Now, go. Be productive this week.
