Most of the time, I try to do deep thinking and make careful decision.

Sometimes, however, I need to abandon my original plan and fight the fire.

Take our design system team as an example. There is no designer in our design system teamâ€”we're still hiring for the right person. Naturally, for the design system, I make quick decisions based on principles and what I believe best at the time.

For example, when a designer contributes to the design system, I work through my way to steward them during the process. If my gut tells me we need to make a new Figma file every time a designer contributes, I share my gut feeling and ask for input. If no one objects, I'll make the decision.

Were my decisions bad? I guess there were some bad decisions. But I had to do it. Otherwise, I'd suffer from decision fatigue.

Firefight is not sustainable. But when the team is still growing, it's often necessary.

This is relevant with level [1 and level 2 decisions][1].
