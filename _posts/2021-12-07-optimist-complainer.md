Both hate the condition.

A complainer sees a condition that is not ideal and complains about it. 

An optimist does the same thing. But do one crucial thing, which is doing something about it, unlike a complainer who waits for someone to do something and change the situation.

Venting is normal. Everyone needs it. But adopting optimism is an important quality to be a good design practitioner. There is evidence that optimistic people present a higher quality of life than those with low levels of optimism or even pessimists. {% include sup.html n=1 %}
