It's problematic when the design team sees other functions as _stakeholders_â€”someone who needs to buy in and decide.

In that world, the designers will try to pitch the idea instead of co-creating the idea with the team.

Pitching culture doesn't help us to solve the real problem, because the discussion will focus on, "Does the boss agree about this?" 

Instead, in the iterative culture, we want to find, "How do we know if we're solving the human problem?" No one in the team know about this, this require continuous experiment.

Pitching culture is also slow. Because you keep going back and forth to convince the "stakeholder."

Co-create instead of pitching if it's possible.
