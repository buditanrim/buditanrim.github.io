A rose has a meaning.

A rose symbolizes modesty. But if someone gives you 13 roses, that person wants to be your forever friend.

It's weird and funny how humans make up stories. How could a flower have any meaning? This happens, arguably, because our brain demand narrative. We make sense of the world with a story.

The problem is, sometimes we tell a story that doesn't make any sense, but we believe it. 

If you ask a question in the meeting and get silent for a few seconds, your brain starts making up a story.

It's your choice to validate that story.
