Partly.

Designing an interface is a mix of logic and art.

On the logic side, you have to know how humans interact with the machine. People receive information, digest it, contemplate it, and take action to achieve their goals. 

On the other hand, it's pretty much an art. You don't have certainty on what is good or bad. Should the button turn darker or lighter when you hover it? How long should it take to animate the sheet that comes from the bottom of the screen? It's subjective. But you get the "aha" moment when it feels right. In the end, there is a part where we use judgment.

It's a complex, back-and-forth process. Creating the sketch helps you think because you can visualize it. Then you think and reflect so you can further explore.
