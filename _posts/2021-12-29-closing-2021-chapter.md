We're at the end of 2021. Some people asked me about how they should start planning for next year. I'd respond to this question with three principles:

One—learn from this year.<br/>
Two—find what excites you.<br/>
Three—build a simple habit, not a plan.<br/>

In this post, let's discuss the first one. We'll talk about the second and the third principle in the following days.

Okay, the idea is simple. You go through each month in 2021. Then, you want to seek three things: 1) Small wins, 2) Small losses, 3) Learnings. Here's how it looks like in steps:

- Go through each month in 2021
- Write small wins/losses
- Reflect on the learnings
- Plan on how to avoid losses, how to reproduce wins

As you ponder month to month, be honest. This note is only for you. Be okay to recognize small losses. For example, I have one that goes like this: I shared irrelevant things at the wrong time with stakeholders and got dismissed.

Now. Go. Flip through the calendar.
