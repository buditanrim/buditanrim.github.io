So, you have [reflected on wins and losses](https://buditanrim.co/2021/closing-2021-chapter/). You also have listed down [what excites you](https://buditanrim.co/2021/find-what-excites-you/). Now, you need to do it.

Don't make a plan. Make a simple and specific habit.

Setting deadlines or targets can be useful. If you want to make a plan, keep it simple like list down milestones. However, without building a habit, your plan can be useless.

B.J. Fogg generously pointed out that if you start a new habit that takes more than 60 seconds, you're less likely to do it.

Want to start reading? Don't just plan what to read and set a target. But set a simple and specific habit. Fill in the blank:

When __ (condition)<br/>
Instead of __ (old habit)<br/>
I will __ (new habit)<br/>

For example, when I wake up at 5 am, instead of going back to sleep, I will go to the kitchen to drink and sit at my desk. Then, of course, reading will take the place of itself.

Happy new year. Go, make things happen in 2022.
