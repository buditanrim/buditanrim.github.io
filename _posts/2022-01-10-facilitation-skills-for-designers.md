A few asked me, *can I be a designer if an introvert?* 

I realized what they actually mean they don't like working with other people. They imagine a designer is a profession where they can make the stuff in the corner. Or they don't know how to work with other people. It's awkward to hear other people's comments on the work. Not to mention, working with people will also involve debate.

Being able to collaborate with the team member is essential. The world is now faster, more connected, and more complex. For example, in 1945, a typical letter could take between twelve and twenty-three days to arrive. Contrasted with the speed of communication today, waiting for twelve days seems unreasonable. Slack or email is one click away from sending a message.

The world is now faster, more connected, and more complex.

Not only does the problem we're facing become more complex, but it's also ever-changing and dynamic. To tackle such a problem requires a multidisciplinary team. Imagine if you want to improve the health system. You'd need to work with engineers, people who understand policy, the industry expert, and so on.

This challenge is not only relevant for designers. For product managers, business people, content strategists. You might find yourself needing to solve problems collaboratively. 

For me, collaboration became less daunting when I learned about facilitation skills. With solid facilitation skills, you can make progress with the team.

Let's talk more about facilitation this month.
