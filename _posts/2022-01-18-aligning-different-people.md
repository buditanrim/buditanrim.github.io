Whether you're at the beginning, the middle, or the end of the project, alignment is essential to make meaningful progress as a team. However, people have different ideas.

Having different opinions is not entirely bad.

A diverse perspective is valuable. It enables us to look at the problem from different angles. An engineer might link the problem with the newest technology, while a researcher might emphasize the users' pain points.

On the other hand, a diverse perspective means people have different ideas. That's where it gets challenging. [Managing discussion](https://buditanrim.co/2022/manage-discussions/) is one thing. The real question is: once we get everyone to voice their opinion, how can we utilize the diverse perspective without getting overwhelmed and make meaningful progress as a team?

Diverge, synthesis, converge. That's the pattern in how you can facilitate many discussions. It is not always suitable for all discussions, but it could work as a starting point for you who want to start being a better facilitator.

Diverge is when people voice their different opinion individually. 

Synthesis is when you as a group find a similar theme.

Converge is when your team reflects and makes a decision.

Tomorrow, let's look at the example of how this plays out in practice.
