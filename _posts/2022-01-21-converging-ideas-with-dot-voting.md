It's a small circle. It's sticky. People use these dot stickers to vote in many design exercises.

Let's say we have five ideas on the whiteboard. We can't build all five for the experiment. We need to choose which idea we feel is worth building now. 

Here's the moment of dot voting can take place.

You give two dots for each person to pick two ideas on the board. Ideally, you'll get one idea that most people in the room choose. Then, you move forward with that idea.

Sometimes, you'll have a tie. Two ideas have an equal vote. If that's the case, you'll have an open discussion and let the decision-maker in the room make a super vote to break the tie.

Dot voting is straightforward and quick. It's a democratic approach to converge. It gives everyone an equal voice to make a decision, which a better approach than letting the loudest voice in the room dominate the decision.

However, like anything else, dot voting has a downside. (to be continued)
