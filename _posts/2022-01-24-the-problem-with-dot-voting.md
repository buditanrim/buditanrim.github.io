While dot voting appears as a quick and democratic decision-making tool, it has flaws.

An obvious flaw is when a person votes on idea A, you get influencedâ€”you see idea A more valuable. People often add their dots where everyone else has dotted. It's a Bandwagon effect in action.

A common criticism is vote-splitting. It is that the team is unable to see the relationship between options. As a result, the team might come to a false conclusion.

Another flaw is dot voting makes us see ideas as equal options. In reality, some ideas have different efforts and different levels of unknowns. If idea B requires larger effort than idea C, why would we see them as an equal option?

Consider to see dot voting as a discussion tool, not for making decisions. If you want, it's better to classify the votes such as:

1.  Green for most impactful.
2.  Blue for low-hanging fruit.
3.  Red for an innovative idea that potentially can be a differentiator.
4.  Yellow for ideas we want to park.

But if that's the case, probably better to use a quadrant.
