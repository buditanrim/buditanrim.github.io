What to consider when designing a listing page?

A listing page like the social media feed or your contact list can appear to be simple. Moreover, it's not a sexy page to focus on, so designers tend to put less attention on it.

On the list page, people have a micro-goal. They want to decide on what to choose or what to read. Basically, the users' scan, and then they make the decision.

So, here's the question for you the next time you design a listing page:

- What decision would the users make here?
- What should they scan so they can make the decision?
- - How can you help users scan optimally?

Sometimes, it's about looking at the problem closer and asking the appropriate questions.
