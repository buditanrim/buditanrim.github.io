Imagine a company that is making a cat toy.

The cat owner, who will make a decision, is the customer.

The cat, who will use the toy, is the user.

This distinction matters, especially in the B2B industry, because you should consider both the customers and the users. You should help the customer make the buying decision by incorporating a clear value proposition in your communication strategy. At the same time, you should consider reducing the pain for the users better than what they have now.
