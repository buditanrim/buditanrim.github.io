Persistence is not repeating the same tactic over and over. That's simply stubborn.

Persistence is about having a similar goal
over and over.

When arguing which approach is better, remind yourself what the goal you're trying to achieve. Then, be flexible on how to achieve it. What matters is to achieve that goal.
