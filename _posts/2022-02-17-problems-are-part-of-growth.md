You may believe "problems" are roadblocks to achieving what you want, but they are actually pathways. Facing a problem pushes you to take action to resolve it, and it will eventually lead you to think differently, behave differently, and choose differently. It becomes a part of your growth. It pushes you out of your comfort zone, that's all.
