Product designers know they have to explore a lot of options.

The problem is designers often kill a design alternative prematurely before examine it further.

When your exploration produces a "bad" alternative, don't throw it too quickly. Reflect and learn from it, ask yourself:

- What is the purpose of this design?
- What works?
- What doesn't work?

List them down.

Then, when you try to come up with a new alternative, maintain what works, reduce what doesn't work, that still aims the purpose of the design.
