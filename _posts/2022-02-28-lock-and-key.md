“You're not running around grabbing every conceivable lock to try out your key. Instead, you're finding people (the lock), and since you are curious about their dreams and desires, you will create a key just for them, one they'll happily trade attention for.” — Seth Godin

I like this statement. A lot of product builders get this simple thing wrong. They start with a solution, then find customers the solution they have. Instead, they should find solutions for the customers.
