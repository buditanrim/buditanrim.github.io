### Challenge
When Yahoo’s team planned to redesign their Yahoo weather application and they need a new set of weather icons because the previous icon set was too generic, not glanceable, and too complex. They looked like this:



### Seek for the meaning and style
I was asked to redesign, but my first attempt was to define the problem and build a simple library for the meaning represented behind each icon. The team also need two set of icons: for small size and large icon.

Reading the definition of each weather term was truly helpful to gain the understanding of what the terms like “windy” actually mean.

The first exploration was really wide and broad to help team see the different style. This exercise produced a few principles that guide as the project progresses, they are: Accessible, expressive, and recognizable. 

- Accessible, primarily the icon have to work perfectly on dark background
- Expressive, to be playful, trendy, and relevant
- Recognizable, in both big and small size. We aligned that the parity of the shape  between big and small icon are also important.

Here is a part of the preliminary exploration:

After narrowing down from many styles, we finally settled on something pretty solid. We embrace the simplicty to increase the glancability, improve readability by utilizing the cast shadow and use color to represent the symbol for recognizibility.

### Reflection
Redesigning weather icons to help millions of users be aware of what the day looks require attention to the details and thoroughness to constantly ask which part should be removed to maintain the simplicity while ensure it recognizable. The team was very helpful to provide context and I glad I did not rush to work on the visual details. Instead, I aligned with the team to get their perspective and constantly discuss, as a result, we are satisfied with the quality and think this can be a timeless asset for Yahoo!

Thanks to Ryan McCullah, Catherine Tai, and Drew Marshall for being very collaborative throughout the process.
