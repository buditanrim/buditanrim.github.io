I want to wake up every morning knowing the future is getting better. To do that, I dedicated my focus to solve social issues.

My current focus as a professional is now in the education field. I believe that improving the education system can generate better future leaders to impact this world positively.

But I can’t do this alone—I believe in the collective effort. This is precisely why I grow a community of problem solvers—to solve a complex social problem at a larger scale through my [blog](https://buditanrim.co) and [newsletter](https://buditanrim.co/newsletter).
